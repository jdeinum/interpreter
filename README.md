# Interpreter

## Overview

Creating a simple stack based programming language in C!

The programming language will support: 
1. Basic Expressions 
2. Strings
3. Global & Local Variables
4. Functions
5. Closures
6. Garbage Collection
7. Classes & Methods
8. Super Classes



Due to school & work, this project was put on hold for quite some time. It will take some time to
get back up to speed.

Robert Nystrom is an excellent author, and all of his books are available for free! On top of that,
his [blog](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/) also contains plenty of cool stuff.

### [The GNU Make Book](https://nostarch.com/gnumake)
Didn't use it too much, but it was a nice reference for any make issues I ran into.
